The [RedBear Duo](http://www.redbear.cc/duo) is a thumb-size development board designed to simplify the process of building Internet of Things (IoT) products. It provides everything you need -- Wi-Fi, BLE and a powerful Cloud backend, all in a compact form factor that makes it ideal for your first prototype, a finished product, and everything in between. [More...](docs/duo_introduction.md)

## ToDo

* Add more BLE examples to the Particle WebIDE and Arduino IDE.

	The BLE examples are not completed yet, for WebIDE, we have not yet added any examples for BLE, if you want to try BLE using WebIDE, please browse [this](https://github.com/redbear/STM32-Arduino/tree/master/arduino/libraries/RedBear_Duo/examples/03.BLE), copy & paste the code to the WebIDE.

* Reduce power consumption for BLE

	We will work with Broadcom to reduce the power consumption for the Duo BLE.
